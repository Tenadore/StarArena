If we do not want the error displayed as a backplate (see backplates folder for examples), and instead as a text label,

We can use these, as they will fit directly to the right of the log in/create account text fields 



"Connecting to server" will be displayed when database is accessed to create a new account. If it reports successful, it will then go to the 
"Account created Successfully" backplate
