The Slider arguments will accept TWO GUIStyles for a slider:

-A thumb
-A bar

Create 2 new GUIStyles using these images, and apply them to your existing slider. Tweaking may be necessary to get the size correct. 
Should be pretty easy.

You can also create a single GUISkin which will accept images for the thumb and slider fields, which you can also apply to the slider.
